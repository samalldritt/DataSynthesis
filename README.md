# DataSynthesis
In development project that will synthesize new fMRI data by randomizing parameters from a chosen uniform distribution and applying to an original dataset
A current problem in the neuoroimaging field is the time, expense, and scarce resources / subjects available for obtaining high quality data, leading to inconsistent analyses
With this in mind, this project aims to synthesize new data that has the same core features of 'real' structural and functional MRI data, but creating potentially infinite variations by sampling parameters from a chosen distribution.

Applies series of matrices operation

## The parameters:
- Affine:
  - Translation
  - Rotation
  - Scaling
-
